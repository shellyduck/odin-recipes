<p>It’s time for a recipe so easy you won’t believe you didn’t think of it yourself! I’m also obsessed with how delicious these noodles turned out. Tossed with lots of aromatic sesame oil, seeds, fresh ginger, garlic, peanut butter, and more! I can’t get enough of them.

Sometimes you need a quick side to accompany dinner, or you might even just want an easy pot of noodles to enjoy as a meal on their own. Throw out those salty “flavor” packets from your packages of ramen and let the noodles shine in this recipe.</p>

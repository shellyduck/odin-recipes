<p>To elevate the savory taste of the dish, add soy sauce. Just enough to lightly season the grains, not overwhelm the palate. It’s easy to make the dish gluten-free with tamari or coconut aminos (this gives a sweeter flavor). Always taste, and add more salt to your liking. 

    In Chinese cuisine, white pepper is used instead of black pepper. It has an exciting ginger-like flavor with a slightly numbing effect. I enjoy using it, plus it doesn’t leave tiny dark speckles on the food. A little goes a long way. Start with an ⅛ of a teaspoon, then add more. Before serving, sprinkle on green onions for a mild allium taste and freshness to the dish.</p>

        <li>Heat a wok or large nonstick skillet over high heat. Add 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil. Once hot, add in cooled rice. Stir-fry to evenly coat with oil. Spread into an even layer, lightly pressing around the pan. Cook for 30-seconds, then stir. Repeat the spreading and moving process every 30-seconds for 5 minutes total to encourage light browning on the surface.</li>
        <li>In the center of the wok, make a large well. Add in 2 teaspoons of vegetable oil. Add onion, garlic, and carrots, stir-fry in the center of the pan for 1 minute, then mix with the rice to combine.</li>
        <li>Make another large well in the center, add in 1 teaspoon vegetable oil and 1 teaspoon sesame oil.</li>
        <li>Pour in beaten eggs. Allow it to sit for about 30 seconds, then gradually stir to create small scrambled egg pieces, stir to combine with the rice.</li>
        <li>Add in soy sauce, stir to combine. Add peas, stir and cook until warmed through, about 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in the salt and white pepper. Taste and season as desired. Garnish with green onions and serve immediately.</li>

<p>My husband’s favorite food is pizza. He likes it plain and simple. A lot of cheese. Sometimes Hawaiian, sometimes BBQ chicken. But most of the time: extra cheese.

    I, on the other hand, am all about the extras. I like my pizza with fun (weird?) toppings like roasted eggplant, goat cheese, sun dried tomatoes, figs, butternut squash, and honey.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Pizza Crust</li>
        <li>Pizza Sauce</li>
        <li>Slice Mozzarella Cheese</li>
        <li>Shredded Mozzarella Cheese</li>
        <li>Parmesan Cheese</li>
        <li>Basil</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the pizza dough through step 6, including preheating the oven to 475°F (246°C) as described in step 4.</li>
        <li>Top the dough with the pizza sauce, then the sliced mozzarella, then the shredded mozzarella, grated Parmesan, then sprinkle with basil.</li>
        <li>Bake for 12-15 minutes. For the last minute, I move the oven rack to the top rack to really brown the edges. That’s optional.</li>
        <li>Slice hot pizza and serve immediately. Cover leftover pizza tightly and store in the refrigerator. Reheat as you prefer. Baked pizza slices can be frozen up to 3 months.</li>
